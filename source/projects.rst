Overview
----------

The Software and Systems laboratory engages in traditional and applied research projects at the intersection of software engineering and computer systems.

Publications
-------------

All SSL publications are maintained in the Loyola University eCommons under the `SSL Collecton <https://ecommons.luc.edu/ssl_pubs>`__.

Publications prior to the formation of SSL (in 2019) can be found in the `Computer Science Collection <https://ecommons.luc.edu/cs_facpubs>`__.


Core Projects
--------------

Core Projects are SSL projecgts that represent active research and development.

.. list-table::

   * - Project Name
     - Project Description

   * - :doc:`metrics_dashboard`
     - The Metrics Dashboard is research software to apply classical in-process and code metrics to observe team progress and project health in open source projects.

   * - :doc:`test_effectiveness`
     - Test effectiveness is an effort to explore existing and new metrics specific to software testing over time. As a code base grows, we hope that its testing code would also grow. We're also interested in how existing metrics (coverage) correlate with classic metrics, such as defect density. 

   * - :doc:`voltkey`
     - The goal of VoltKey is to make deployment and maintenance of new IoT devices easy. Currently, when we install new IoT devices, we need to go through a complex process of connecting the device to the WiFi network. With VoltKey, no configuration is necessary: you just plug the new device in and it works.

Collaborative Projects
-----------------------

Collaborative Projects are efforts with one or more *external* institutions.

   * - Project Name
     - Project Description

   * - Computer Vision
     - Effort with Purdue University ECE

   * - Neuroscience
     - Effort with Argonne National Laboratory and University of Buenos Aires

   * - :doc:`shape_analysis`
     - The Shape Analysis project is a collaboration between Loyola University Chicago, Louisisana State University, and Uniersity of Connecticut that explores the performance of machine learning algorithms on the classification of fossil teeth in the Family Bovidae. Isolated bovid teeth are typically the most common fossils found in southern Africa and they often constitute the basis for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Taxonomic identification of fossil bovid teeth, however, is often imprecise and subjective. Using modern teeth with known taxons, machine learning algorithms can be trained to classify fossils.

Incubation Projects
---------------------

Incubation Projects are either in early stages or have temporarily taken a "back burner" status until faculty and students are available to continue working on them.

   * - Project Name
     - Project Description

   * - :doc:`lute`
     - The Loyola University Technology Ensemble performs using a collection of tools for interactive music performance. These tools alow for group performance on laptops and to allow for tracking of progress through a group-performed composition.

   * - :doc:`zettelgeist`
     - ZettelGeist is a plaintext note-taking system, inspired by the `ZettelKasten <https://zettelkasten.de/>`__ Method. 

   * - :doc:`hermes`
     - Hermes is a hypervisor for MCU-based systems with real-time requirements. The goal of Hermes is to manage tradeoffs between performance and flexibility in software that runs on embedded systems.
