Open CS Initiative
==================

Introduction
------------
In order to uphold our commitment to developing open-source software, open access and dissmeination of research software, and creating repeatable results, we as an organization understand the need to provide resources and educational materials to all members. However, we recognize that |SSL| is not a limitless organization. In order to meet both the educational and academic needs of our researchers and faculty, the Open CS Initiative was created.

Project Abstract
----------------
The Open CS Initiative is an attempt to create a database of freely and legally availible resources, tools, and training that anyone (including those outside of |SSL|) can use and contribute to. This is a glorified spreadsheet that contains direct links to software, books, projects, videos, podcasts, documentation, etc. While this is not the first attempt at creating such a list, |SSL| believes that this could prove to be an invaluable tool for researchers and students of all backgrounds.

Features
--------
The Open CS Initiative consists of two parts:

1. An internal reading group/ podcast hosted by members of SSL.
2. A searchable static website that contains all of the links aggregated by members of the Computer Science community.

The reading group/ podcast is an internally ran project that meets weekly to discuss the latest research in the field of Computer Science, Software Engineering, Cyber Security, and Information Technology. All meetings will be recorded and published to YouTube. More information can be found on the :doc:`Reading Group (reading-group)` page.

The searchable static website is the deliverable of the Open CS Initiative project. More information on it can be found `here`_.

Other Projects
--------------
|SSL| acknowledges that it is not the first to attempt such a project. As such, and in the spirit of the project itself, below is a list of websites that have been created prior to this project.

.. note::
    Some of the links from these websites have been used within the Open CS Initiative project. |SSL| thanks those that have worked on these sites and their desires to provide an open education to those pursing their dreams in the field of Computer Science, Software Engineering, Cyber Security, and Information Technology.

.. note::
    Unlike other projects, the Open CS Initiative is a permanently ongoing project that is unlikely to change course during its existance. In other words, there is no finish line for this project.
