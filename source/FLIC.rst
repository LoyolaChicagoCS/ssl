FLIC: Fog Linked Internet of Things Cache
=========================================

FLIC is a project in the field of fog computing. 
Fog computing is an exciting new area of research in computer science.
Fog computation began as an off-shoot of cloud computing but in the past five years has started to become it's own thing.
FLIC approaches the motivation of, "What if we take the good from fog computing and combine it with the good from cloud computing?"
FLIC acts as a shared cache within a fog system.
With FLIC we were able to save an exponential amount of data leaving fog networks.
With a shared consistent cache, the fog can act as one machine like a cloud but yet still retain the individuality of independent fog notes.
