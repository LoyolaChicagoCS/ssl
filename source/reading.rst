Reading Group
==============

The SSL embraces an old-fashioned concept of *reading papers*. In addition, we are hoping to make a *podcast* around our discussions of papers we are reading (starting 2020). Participating in the reading group requires the willingness to read the paper *prior* to attending the discussion.

Schedule
----------

The Reading Group typically meets from 1-2pm on Fridays in Doyle Center 214, which is available via Google Calendar:
