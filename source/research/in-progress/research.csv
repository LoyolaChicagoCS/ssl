|TE|, "|TE| is an effort to explore existing and new metrics specific to software testing over time. As a codebase grows, we hope that its testing code would also grow. Weâ€™re also interested in how existing metrics (coverage) correlate with classic metrics, such as defect density"
|VoltKey|, "The goal of |VoltKey| is to make the deployment and maintenance of new IoT devices easy. Currently, when we install new IoT devices, we need to go through a complex process of connecting the device to the WiFi network. With |VoltKey|, no configuration is necessary: you just plug the new device in and it works"
