VoltKey
=========

The goal of VoltKey is to make the deployment and maintenance of new IoT devices easy. Currently, when we install new IoT devices, we need to go through a complex process of connecting the device to the WiFi network. With VoltKey, no configuration is necessary: you just plug the new device in and it works.

VoltKey is a plug that generates USB power for IoT devices from a 120V wall outlet. It harvests entropy (noise) from the wall power and generates a unique security key that the IoT device can use to authenticate to the local WiFi network.
