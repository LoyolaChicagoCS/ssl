        - |Metrics Dashboard|
        - The Metrics Dashboard is research software to apply classical in-process and code metrics to observe team progress and project health in open source projects.

        - |TE|
        - Test effectiveness is an effort to explore existing and new metrics specific to software testing over time. As a codebase grows, we hope that its testing code would also grow. Weâ€™re also interested in how existing metrics (coverage) correlate with classic metrics, such as defect density.

        - |VoltKey|
        - The goal of VoltKey is to make the deployment and maintenance of new IoT devices easy. Currently, when we install new IoT devices, we need to go through a complex process of connecting the device to the WiFi network. With VoltKey, no configuration is necessary: you just plug the new device in and it works.
