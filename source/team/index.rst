=============

Introduction
------------
The Software and Systems Laboratory is led by a core group of computer science and interdisciplinary faculty with projects that span software engineering and computer systems. We work as peers when it comes to day-to-day life in the research group. We rely upon our current members to grow the research group to include new researchers and faculty with synergistic interests. In the spirit of being true peers, we list all names in alphabetical order by last name.
