Non-Local Mean Curvature
========================

This project has two goals. One goal is mathematical, the project wants to estimate abstract curve's Non-Local Mean Curvature (NLC). The estimations will help analyitcal mathmaticions observe various properties about curves in euclidian space.
The second goal is much more computer science oriented. The second goal is to write the algorithm to compute the NLC. This is not simple and there has never been a proper algoritm to preform this computation in an abstract sense.
We plan to write the first aglorithm to compute the NLC for any function.
Although, one thing that the math tells us is that most implementations will be slow due to the intensity of the integrals.
We plan to then write the integration algorithm using the CUDA API.
