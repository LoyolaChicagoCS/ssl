Welcome to SSL
================

Hi there! Thank you for checking out the Software Systems Laboratory website. We’re based in the Computer Science Department at Loyola University Chicago. SSL researches computer systems and applied software engineering. We foster innovation by encouraging experimentation and collaboration with a strong emphasis on openness, including open-source software development, open access dissemination of research software, and reproducible results. We are an interdisciplinary group with faculty and student interests in computer science, software engineering, information technology, cybersecurity, and engineering. We are a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) group, which means that we align ourselves not only with the sciences and mathematics but also with arts and humanities disciplines.

SSL embraces the notion that diversity drives creativity and innovation. Following the principles of the IEEE Special Technical Community on Broadening Participation, all are welcome, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic advantage, physical, mental, and cognitive ability, and LGBTQA+ status. Whilst we are based at Loyola University Chicago, we welcome anyone interested in using emerging technologies and software engineering to solve problems.

To join the research group, you must apply. Current team members interview prospective team members, followed by an interview with the director, and affiliated faculty. Decisions are based on previous development experience, the ability to work in a team setting, and a statement of purpose. All Loyola University Chicago participants are eligible to apply for independent study. Regardless of whether one earns credit or non-credit, we expect participants to make at least a 6-month commitment to remain inactive status within the research group.
