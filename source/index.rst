Welcome to SSL
==============

Hello World!
------------
Thank you for checking out the Software and Systems Laboratory (|SSL|) website. We are a research laboratory based in the `Computer Science Department at Loyola University Chicago`_.

Our |Members| form an interdisciplinary group with :doc:`faculty and student interests </research/index>` in computer science, software engineering, information technology, cybersecurity, and engineering.

The laboratory's focus is on researching computer systems and applied software engineering to solve |STEAM|-related problems.

Methodology
-----------
We foster innovation by encouraging experimentation and collaboration with a strong emphasis on openness. To uphold this commitment, we enforce `open-source software development`_, open access, and dissemination of research software by creating reproducible results within all of our projects.

|SSL| embraces the notion that diversity drives creativity and innovation. We follow the principles of the `IEEE Special Technical Community on Broadening Participation`_ allowing anyone regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, physical, mental, and cognitive ability, or LGBTQA+ status to join our lab.

Apply
-----
While we are based at Loyola University Chicago (|LUC|), we welcome anyone interested in using emerging technologies and software engineering to solve problems.

To learn more about how to apply, see our |Apply| page.
