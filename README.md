About
==================

This is the repository behind the [SSL](https://ssl.cs.luc.edu) web site at Loyola University Chicago, directed by [George K. Thiruvathukal](https://thiruvathukal.com).

Our site uses the Sphinx and rebuilds on all commits.

In addition, we periodically do a release of the site in PDF and EPUB formats for those who might want to have a printable "book" about the group. In general, this is mostly for spectator value to show how to build and publish Sphinx artifacts in web and other formats using continuous integration systems (e.g. Travis).

Members of the research group are invited to submit pull requests for content changes or enter issues in the issue tracker so we can make the changes for you.
